# Our design goals

We wanted to make a metroidvania style hack n' slash with a simple yet fun movement system and many fodder enemies to make
the game satisfying to play through.

## Features

- Slash Combos: We wanted to allow the player to slash multiple times, with the possibility of mixing inputs to let the
  player perform attack combos, for example a spin attack or charge attack.

- Dash Mechanic: We wanted to implement a mechanic that would allow the player to dash in the air, inflicting damage to
  enemies and allowing the player to bounce off enemies dealing damage to them. This would allow for interesting movement and
  attacking decisions.

- Boss Fight: We wanted to make a fun boss fight at the end of the game to challenge the player's skill.

- Platforming: We wanted the movement to feel good and satisfying.

- Dialogue: We wanted to add a bit of flair by adding dialogue to the game.
